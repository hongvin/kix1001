### The technology behind this website

Ever wonder how this website is built? The website uses the following technologies:

- Markdown: Formatting the pages
- Jekyll: Posting the Markdown file into nice HTML
- LaTeX: All the mathematics font rendered.

LaTeX is a good tool to format and linting mathematical equations. Not only it is nice to view, it can support long, complex mathematic equations, which could not support well by Microsoft Word Equation.
